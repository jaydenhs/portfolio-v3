  # Defining the Problem

  <section>
    On the existing online renewal platform, there were customer feedback forms. We categorized over 1,600 submissions to identify prominent complaints, resulting in the diagnosis of three major issues:

    <NumberedList
      data={[
        {
          title: 'Difficult to find the appropriate service',
          description:
            "Users found it difficult to renew the appropriate service due to the system's limitations, which required simultaneous renewal of both driver's license and health card, and made it challenging to find the option to renew only the driver's license if the initial link was not clicked correctly.",
        },
        {
          title: "Confusing error messaging",
          description:
            "Users expressed frustration with the lack of explanation provided when their renewal was denied, stating that they were not given a reason or indication of ineligibility after entering their  information.",
        },
        {
          title: 'Redundant and convoluted text and questions',
          description:
            'Users found it frustrating to repeatedly enter their name and address despite indicating there had been no changes.',
        },
      ]}

  # The Problem

  <section>
    We have observed that the ServiceOntario online renewal flows are not meeting user needs, which is causing low completion rates, negative user feedback, inclusion concerns, and low uptake on digital services.

    How might we design a one-window digital renewal transaction flow that promotes usability and inclusion by reducing time on task and increasing positive feedback on eligibility?

  # Creating Our Concept

  <section>
    <SideBySide src="process-ideation.png">
      ### Ideation
      Our team individually sketched user flows and interfaces in five-minute brainstorming sessions and presented our designs to the group.

      ### Consolidation
      We then combined the strengths of our ideas into a final user flow that represented our team’s vision of the redesigned renewal service’s golden path.
