  # Defining the Problem

  <section>
    On the existing ServiceOntario online renewal platform, there were customer feedback forms. We categorized over 1,600 submissions to identify prominent complaints, resulting in the diagnosis of three major issues:
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <NumberedList
      data={[
        {
          title: 'Difficult to find the appropriate service',
          description:
            "Users found it difficult to renew the appropriate service due to the system's limitations, which required simultaneous renewal of both driver's license and health card, and made it challenging to find the option to renew only the driver's license if the initial link was not clicked correctly.",
        },
        {
          title: "Confusing error messaging",
          description:
            "Users expressed frustration with the lack of explanation provided when their renewal was denied, stating that they were not given a reason or indication of ineligibility after entering their  information.",
        },
        {
          title: 'Redundant and convoluted text and questions',
          description:
            'Users found it frustrating to repeatedly enter their name and address despite indicating there had been no changes.',
        },
      ]}
    />

  # The Problem

  <section>
    We have observed that the ServiceOntario online renewal flows are not meeting user needs, which is causing low completion rates, negative user feedback, inclusion concerns, and low uptake on digital services.

    How might we design a digital renewal transaction flow that promotes usability and inclusion by reducing time on task and increasing positive feedback on eligibility?

  # Creating Our Concept

  <section>
    <SideBySide src="process-ideation.png" maxWidth={1440}>
      ### Ideation
      Our team individually sketched user flows and interfaces in five-minute brainstorming sessions and presented our designs to the group.
    </SideBySide>
    <SideBySide src="process-consolidate.jpg" mediaOnRight maxWidth={1440}>
      ### Consolidation
      We then combined the strengths of our ideas into a final user flow that represented our team’s vision of the redesigned renewal service’s golden path.
    </SideBySide>
    <SideBySide src="process-lowfi.png" maxWidth={1440}>
      ### Low Fidelity Prototype
      With our lead designer, my fellow product designer and I then created a low-fidelity Balsamiq prototype that simulated this ideated flow.

  # Testing with the Public

  <section>
    Equipped with a low-fidelity prototype of our redesigned renewal platform, my co-designers and I traveled to downtown Toronto to conduct weekly guerilla user testing at the busiest ServiceOntario centre. Over the span of three weeks, I facilitated 23 15-minute interviews.

    <div className="wide grid md:grid-cols-7 gap-4">
      <Image className="md:col-span-2 my-auto rounded-xl" src="user-testing-1.jpg"/>
      <Image className="md:col-span-3 rounded-xl" src="portrait-1.jpg"/>
      <Image className="md:col-span-2 my-auto rounded-xl" src="user-testing-2.jpg"/>
    </div>
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  # Content is Key

  <section>
    A dominant complaint about our designs was a lack of clarity in its content. With a month of experience in the problem space, our team likely had become so familiar with government terminology that we had not considered how confusing its use would be to our user base.

    We partnered with a content designer to implement users' feedback as we iterated our designs from low to high fidelity:

    <BeforeAndAfter title="Remove ambiguous language" src={["ambiguous-b.png", "ambiguous-a.png"]} />
    <BeforeAndAfter title="Include next steps after errors" src={["include-b.png", "include-a.png"]} />
    <BeforeAndAfter title="Describe complex terminology" src={["complex-b.png", "complex-a.png"]} />
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  # Optimizing for Mobile

  <section>
    Through testing, we also discovered a crucial oversight in our initial design approach. Our team had overlooked the limitations of phone screens while designing, focusing instead on complete wireframes. However, user feedback on smaller screens highlighted the need for revisions to ensure a seamless mobile user experience.

    To rectify this issue, we implemented the following design changes:

    <BeforeAndAfter title="Keep essentials above the fold" src={["starting-b.png", "starting-a.png"]} />
    <BeforeAndAfter title="Surface helpful information first" src={["surface-b.png", "surface-a.png"]} />

  # The Launch

  <section>
    Using our Figma prototype, we collaborated with our in-lab developers to develop <AutoLink to="https://sorenewals.firebaseapp.com/">an interactive webapp prototype</AutoLink>. We summarized our research and handed off our prototypes to the executives of the Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Health.

      "Jayden understands complex nuances quickly and thinks in a user-centric way. He is excellent at trying something, getting valuable input from real users, iterating, and documenting findings. Beyond great results, it's a pleasure to work and collaborate with him. He's a quick study and also a collaborative partner with subject matter experts."

    Our findings proved instrumental in <AutoLink to="https://www.ontario.ca/page/renew-drivers-licence">the newest iteration of Ontario's online driver's licence and health card renewal platform</AutoLink>, which launched in October 2021. Here are some metrics from the launch:
  </section>

  <section>
    <Metrics disclaimer>
      Online renewal rates increased by 8%
      
      Customer complaints decreased by 17%

      Time to renewal completion decreased by 12%

    Working in the Ontario Digital Service Kitchener-Waterloo Lab was an unforgettable experience. Not only did projects such as this allow me to exponentially grow my skillset through exposure to unique, enterprise-level opportunities, but this small but mighty team of six taught me how to enjoy every second of it!
