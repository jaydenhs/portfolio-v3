<Intro>
  ## I was a UX/UI Design Intern at <AutoLink light to="https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking">TD Canada Trust's</AutoLink> innovation lab, a team focused on equipping students for post-secondary financial challenges.
  ## I designed, implemented, and tested a multi-platform, accessible Figma design system that **increased prototyping efficiency by 16%**.

  # Context

  <section>
    As a UX/UI design intern at TD's Innovation Lab, I was tasked with rapidly
    prototyping experiences that could impact millions of users.

    Within my first week, I quickly realized that there was no complete source or
    conceptual documentation for styles, UI elements, or design patterns. In such an
    agile environment, this led to severe inefficiencies in our design
    workflows.

    So, I embarked on a self-driven project to create the foundation for TD Lab's
    design system.

  # The Problem

  <section>
    We have observed that the TD Lab design library is not meeting user needs, which
    is causing **inefficient** design workflows and poor accessibility in
    prototypes.

    How might we build a **design library** that promotes inclusion and innovation
    by improving accessibility documentation and reducing time spent on creating and
    updating interface elements?

  # Collecting the Parts

  <section>
    ## Inventory

    My next task was to inventory the common UI elements used in the lab's previous
    projects. I collected Sketch project files, analyzed the current pattern
    library, read over the minimal Atlassian documentation we had, and took
    screenshots of previous projects.

    ## Audit

    Once I felt I had captured every button, icon, and design pattern I grouped them
    into categories. Viewing them side-by-side revealed exactly why we needed a
    system. Without any documentation, many of our prototypes lacked in
    accessibility, with elements being used incorrectly and colours not satisfying
    contrast ratios.

  # Researching Best Practices

  <section>
    To ensure that the design library was future-proof, I started this project with
    some heavy research into design library and UI design best practices.

    I studied Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and Google's Material Design
    Guidelines, analyzed design systems from Atlassian, Uber, Github, and Figma, and
    read through countless Medium articles.

  # The Structure

  <section>
    Inspired by Dropbox's design system, I decided to structure the design library
    in a two-tiered hierarchy:

    By creating separate UI Kits that inherit from Global Styles, we get the best of
    both worlds - the consistency of having shared styles with the flexibility of
    being able to toggle on specific UI kits based on the project scope.

  # Testing the System

  <section>
    (While I was building, I was communicating progress to the other designers, allowing them to use it. I was also using it on my other lab projects, to get a feel for it. This allowed me to collect and implement feedback as I went.)
