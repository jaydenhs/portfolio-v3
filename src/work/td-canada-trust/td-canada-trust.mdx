<Intro>
  ## I was a UX/UI Design Intern at <AutoLink light to="https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking">TD Canada Trust's</AutoLink> innovation lab, a team focused on equipping students for post-secondary financial challenges.
  ## I designed, implemented, and tested a multi-platform, accessible Figma design system that **increased prototyping efficiency by 16%**.

  # Context

  <section>
    At TD's innovation lab, I was tasked with rapidly prototyping experiences that could impact millions of TD's student customers.

    Within my first week, I realized that there was no source for styles, UI elements, or design patterns. This led to inefficiencies in our design workflows, poor accessibility, and confusion inconsistencies during user testing.

    Thus, I embarked on a self-driven project to create the foundation for TD Lab's design system.

  # The Problem

  <section>
    We have observed that the TD Lab design library is not meeting user needs, which
    is causing inefficient design workflows and poor accessibility in
    prototypes.

    How might we build a design library that promotes inclusion and innovation
    by improving accessibility documentation and reducing time spent on creating and
    updating interface elements?

  # Crafting the Foundation

  <section>
    ## Observation

    My first order of business was to understand how the lab currently designed.
    After a few conversations, it was evident that while the lab did have an minimal
    Sketch pattern library, its unfinished nature resulted in a lot of time being
    spent on creating user interface elements from scratch.
  </section>
  <section>
    ## Inventory

    My next task was to inventory the common UI elements used in the lab's previous
    projects. I collected Sketch project files, analyzed the current pattern
    library, read over the minimal Atlassian documentation we had, and took
    screenshots of previous projects.
  </section>
  <section>
    ## Audit

    Once I felt I had captured every button, icon, and design pattern I grouped them
    into categories. Viewing them side-by-side revealed exactly why we needed a
    system. Without any documentation, many of our prototypes lacked in
    accessibility, with elements being used incorrectly and colours not satisfying
    contrast ratios.
  </section>
  <section>
    ## Research

    To ensure that the design library was future-proof, I started this project with some heavy research into design library and UI design best practices. I studied Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and Google's Material Design Guidelines, analyzed design systems from Atlassian, Uber, Github, and Figma, and read through countless Medium articles.

  # The Structure

  <section>
    Inspired by Dropbox's design system, I decided to structure the design library
    in a two-tiered hierarchy:

    <Image src="design-system-structure.png"/>

    By creating separate UI Kits that inherit from Global Styles, we get the best of
    both worlds - the consistency of having shared styles with the flexibility of
    being able to toggle on specific UI kits based on the project scope.

  # Testing the System

  <section>
    While building the design system, I communicated progress, gathering feedback via Slack and meetings for iterative enhancement. I also tested myself it other lab projects, gauging visual harmony, navigation, and usability.
