<Intro>
## I was a Design Technologist Intern at <AutoLink to="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</AutoLink>, a global commerce platform that empowers millions of merchants worldwide to sell online, offline, and everywhere in between.
## I co-designed, prototyped, and launched a reimagined on-site search experience on <AutoLink to="https://shopify.dev/">shopify.dev</AutoLink>, Shopify's third-party developer documentation site.

  # Context

  <div className="sub-section">
    This is what the current on-site search experience looked like:
    <div className="full-bleed">
      <Video path="current-site.webm" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="sub-section pt-6">
    Third-party developers found the current search experience **clunky and
    irrelevant**, leading to **only 0.5% of daily users using our on-site search**.

    > "Your search functionality is awful. I use Google instead of your built-in
    > search bar to search the docs. It needs some tender love and care."

  # The Challenge

  <div className="sub-section">
    With shopify.dev containing thousands of pages, the **inefficiency of our
    on-site search** resulted in third-party developers being unable to find key API
    resources quickly. This led to **decreased Shopify app ecosystem productivity**.

  # Understanding the Infrastructure

  <div className="sub-section">
    First, I dove deep into understanding the current technical infrastructure.

    Through this, I diagnosed foundational problems with how the backend was
    serializing content. **We were giving messy information to our search engine
    (ElasticSearch), and had terrible result relevancy as a result.**

    This deep-dive also helped me set a shared understanding in my team of how our
    search currently works.

  # Defining UX Principles

  <div className="sub-section">
    Our design team started defining principles and solutions based on our
    assumptions. But we were stopped by our product manager, who **questioned what
    evidence these decisions were being based on.**

    So we took a step back, and interviewed eight third-party developers. Based on
    the frequency and intensity of their feedback, we defined the UX principles of
    our search:

    1. ### Design search results for scannability <p>Instead of manually parsing through cluttered descriptions and breadcrumbs, developers can now rely on scannable results to quickly identify the best option for their use case.</p>
    2. ### Filtered search for the win <p>For a continuously-expanding information site like shopify.dev, providing developers the ability to narrow a large set of results down is critical.</p>
    3. ### Personalize the experience <p>Developers only cared about the one or two APIs used in their work. By saving their filters, our on-site search experience would be more frictionless.</p>

  # Wireframing

  <div className="sub-section">
    Following a competitive analysis and low-fidelity designs, I collaborated with
    our senior product designer and content designer to create high-fidelity Figma
    wireframes based on our principles:

  # Prototyping

  <div className="sub-section">
    **I created a prototype in our production codebase with React, Ruby on Rails,
    and ElasticSearch.**

    <Image src="shopify/tech-stack.jpg" />

    I focused on designing the interaction-heavy filtering experiences that couldn't
    easily be replicated in Figma, and would benefit the most from being
    experimented with in a production environment.
    
    Here's what my prototype looked like:
