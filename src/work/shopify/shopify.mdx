<Intro>
## I was a Design Technologist Intern at <AutoLink to="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</AutoLink>, a global commerce platform that empowers millions of merchants worldwide to sell online, offline, and everywhere in between.
## I co-designed, prototyped, and launched a reimagined on-site search experience on <AutoLink to="https://shopify.dev/">shopify.dev</AutoLink>, Shopify's third-party developer documentation site.

  # Context

  <div className="sub-section">
    This is what the current on-site search experience looked like:
    <div className="wide">
      <Video src="shopify/current-site.webm" />
    </div>
  </div>

  <div className="sub-section pt-6">
    Third-party developers found the current search experience **clunky and
    irrelevant**, leading to **only 0.5% of daily users using our on-site search**.

    > "Your search functionality is awful. I use Google instead of your built-in
    > search bar to search the docs. It needs some tender love and care."
    >

  # The Challenge

  <div className="sub-section">
    With shopify.dev containing thousands of pages, the **inefficiency of our
    on-site search** resulted in third-party developers being unable to find key API
    resources quickly. This led to **decreased Shopify app ecosystem productivity**.
  </div>
</section>

  # Understanding the Infrastructure

  <div className="sub-section">
    First, I dove deep into understanding the current technical infrastructure.

    Through this, I diagnosed foundational problems with how the backend was
    serializing content. **We were giving messy information to our search engine
    (ElasticSearch), and had terrible result relevancy as a result.**
    <Image src="shopify/search-serialization.png" divClassName="full-bleed" />
    This deep-dive also helped me set a shared understanding in my team of how our
    search currently works.

  # Defining UX Principles

  <div className="sub-section">
    Our design team started defining principles and solutions based on our
    assumptions. But we were stopped by our product manager, who **questioned what
    evidence these decisions were being based on.**

    So we took a step back, and interviewed eight third-party developers. Based on
    the frequency and intensity of their feedback, we defined the UX principles of
    our search:

    1. ### Design search results for scannability <p>Instead of manually parsing through cluttered descriptions and breadcrumbs, developers can now rely on scannable results to quickly identify the best option for their use case.</p>
    2. ### Filtered search for the win <p>For a continuously-expanding information site like shopify.dev, providing developers the ability to narrow a large set of results down is critical.</p>
    3. ### Personalize the experience <p>Developers only cared about the one or two APIs used in their work. By saving their filters, our on-site search experience would be more frictionless.</p>
  </div>

  # Wireframing

  <div className="sub-section">
    Following a competitive analysis and low-fidelity designs, I collaborated with
    our senior product designer and content designer to create high-fidelity Figma
    wireframes based on our principles:

    <Image src="shopify/search-modal.jpg" divClassName="full-bleed rounded-xl" />
  </div>

<section>
  # Prototyping

  <div className="sub-section">
    **I created a prototype in our production codebase with React, Ruby on Rails,
    and ElasticSearch.**

    <Image src="shopify/tech-stack.jpg" />

    I focused on designing the interaction-heavy filtering experiences that couldn't
    easily be replicated in Figma, and would benefit the most from being
    experimented with in a production environment.
    
    Here's what my prototype looked like:

    <div className="pt-12 space-y-24">
      <Video src="shopify/using-tabs.webm">
        ### Filter-by-category tabs
        Based on the search query, the search modal would display category-specific tabs. On click, the tabs would display results from that category. A mixture of results would be displayed by default in the 'All' tab.
      </Video>
      <Video src="shopify/dynamic-tabs.webm">
        ### Dynamic tab positioning
        These tabs would be dynamically ordered from left-to-right based on the relevance of their respective categories.    
      </Video>
      <Video src="shopify/filter-checkboxes.webm">
        ### Personalized filters
        The search modal would also enable developers to view content only from selected categories. This helped developers focus on results for the Shopify APIs of their current project.
      </Video>
      <Video src="shopify/filter-cookies.webm">
        ### Saving filters
        Even after navigating to away from the page, selected filters were preserved using cookies.
      </Video>
      <Video src="shopify/filter-clear-all.webm">
        ### Clearing filters
        If a developer wanted to remove their filters, they could clear them in one click.
      </Video>
    </div>
  </div>

  # Defining Edge Cases

  <div className="sub-section">
    My prototype also challenged our design team to solve edge cases we hadn't
    accounted for in our wireframes. 
    
    For example, to limit the length of the 'All (results)' tab, we truncated the
    search results displayed in each section. After experimenting with different
    algorithms, our design team chose the path that best complimented the
    functionality in our designs.

    <Video src="shopify/es-truncation.webm" caption="Results below the score threshold (highlighted in red) were retained to preserve 'View all results' functionality"/>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  # Implementing for the Keyboard

  <div className="sub-section">
    Another strength of coded prototypes is that it enabled our design team to
    design keyboard navigation, a feature required for developers.

    Here's what opening, navigating, and selecting in the search modal looked like:

    <Video src="shopify/keyboard-accessibility.webm" caption="Interactions were linked to / (open search bar), arrow keys (result navigation), Esc (close search bar), and Enter (open selected result)"/>
  </div>
</section>

  # Learnings

  <div className="sub-section">
    1. ### Don't operate on assumptions <p>Our team got too excited and made the mistake of defining UX principles before research. Had we not talked to developers, we wouldâ€™ve not solved their biggest pain points. If I was to do this project again, I would start with research.</p>
    2. ### Prototyping is so, so rewarding <p>It is _incredibly_ empowering to prototype interaction-heavy experiences that would otherwise be impossible to create with traditional design software. The level of clarity it can bring to stakeholder conversations and user testing is unmatched.</p>
